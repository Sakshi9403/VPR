# Visual Product Recognition
Visual product recognition an Image-Based Product Search using YOLOv3 and Streamlit

# Overview
This project aims to revolutionize traditional text-based web searches by enabling users to conduct product searches using images. Leveraging YOLOv3 (a deep learning model) and Streamlit, users can upload images of desired products and receive relevant links to purchase them.

# Features
- Image Upload: Users can upload images of products they wish to search for.
- YOLOv3 Model: Utilizes YOLOv3 for object detection within uploaded images.
- Link Generation: Provides links to purchase identified products from various sources.
- SQLite3 Integration: Stores and manages data using SQLite3 for efficient retrieval and management.

# Technologies Used
- Python: Main programming language for development.
- YOLOv3: Deep learning model for object detection.
- SQLite3: Database management for storing product information.
- Streamlit: Web app framework for the user interface.
